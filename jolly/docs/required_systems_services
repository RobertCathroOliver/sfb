EnergyConsumer service
- an interface for energy allocation
- indicates how much energy this system consumes and which types
- indicates how it interacts with reserve power

FrequencyRestriction service
- indicates how often the system can be used
- impulses-between-uses
- uses-per-turn
- previous-use
- later of now + 8 impulse or next turn 1st impulse
- how to use this with phaser-Gs?

EnergyAllocation unit service
- determines how much energy systems produce
- determines which system can consume energy
- apportions energy to systems that need it
- sets up speed plot

PhaserCapacitor system
- functions as a ResourcePool for phaser firing
- 

WeaponTarget for units
- indicates which weapons it can be targeted by
