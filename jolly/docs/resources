I need a system for handling resources.

Resources need:
1. An identifier (URI)
2. A representation (JSON or XML)
3. Persistence (in a DB)
4. Behaviour response (HTTP verbs)

1. Identifiers
Each accessible object in the domain has an identifier.
These objects are accessible:
  game, player, user
  unit, map
  timeline, breakpoint, command
  ssd, system
  energy allocation, speed plot

These objects have a value, but no identifier:
  location, direction, position
  time

2. Representations
Equivalent XML and JSON representations exist for each resource.
For some resources, an aggregate representation with identifiers to its members may be available.
Values have their own representation.
location - 4-digit coordinates (xxyy)
direction - alphabetic identifier (A, B, C, D, E, F)
position - location + direction (e.g. 0323C)
time - turn.phase or turn.impulse.phase (e.g. 2.energy-allocation or 2.3.movement)

3. Persistence
Each resource can be persisted to a database and retrieved.
A unique identifier (perhaps the URI, or some part of it) is required to establish resource identity.

4. Behaviours
Each resource can respond to at least some of the HTTP verbs GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
All resources can respond to GET.
Commands can respond to all verbs although some verbs may be forbidden at some times.
Breakpoints can respond to all verbs.
Aggregates respond to GET and POST.
Other resources respond to GET, PUT and DELETE.
Domain logic may be triggered by a verb.
Domain logic is keyed to event handlers.
OnCreating, OnCreated, OnUpdating, OnUpdated, OnDeleting, OnDeleted
